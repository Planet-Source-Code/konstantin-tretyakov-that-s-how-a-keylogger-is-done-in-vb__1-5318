Here is an example of how to use hooks in VB
The point is, that to set a global hook, you need a DLL
And it can't be made in VB, so here is a DLL, written in Delphi
and an example of it's usage.

If you like and use this code, I would appreciate if you included me
in the Greetings section, AboutBox, etc...:)
